         The gender pay gap is a measurement of the wage disparity between men and women in the United States.<br>
      The gender wage gap is based on separate data sets and data science undertaken by numerous reputable entities.<br>
      The salary disparity between men and women repeats year after year, demonstrating that the reasons for the pay<br>
      disparity are systematic and reflect how society appreciates women's labor less than men's.<br> </P>
  
  
  
          <p style="text-align:left;">
          The roots of the gender pay gap, according to research, are systemic, meaning that they arise from people's <br>
          judgments — conscious or unconscious — of the worth of women's labor versus men's work, and the types of employment <br>
          that women are suited for. Women are typically channeled into lower-paying roles as a result of these attitudes, with <br>
          the assumption that they do not have to work or that the work they perform should be related to childcare, homemaking, <br>
          and nurturing. It's also worth mentioning that labor labeled "women's work" is regarded as less important unless males <br>
          work in those fields. Women were, for example, the primary "computers," but computing jobs paid little until men entered the area.
