          The roots of the gender pay gap, according to research, are systemic, meaning that they arise from people's <br>
          judgments — conscious or unconscious — of the worth of women's labor versus men's work, and the types of employment <br>
          that women are suited for. Women are typically channeled into lower-paying roles as a result of these attitudes, with <br>
          the assumption that they do not have to work or that the work they perform should be related to childcare, homemaking, <br>
          and nurturing. It's also worth mentioning that labor labeled "women's work" is regarded as less important unless males <br>
          work in those fields. Women were, for example, the primary "computers," but computing jobs paid little until men entered the area.

        What we have created is a scatterplot. The first drop-down menu is showing data points for each gender. <br>
        You have the choice to either filter and view male or female data. The second and third dropdown menus both change their x <br>
        and y-axis to compare the different values in our data frame for example we have age, evaluation, seniority, salary, and bonus amount. <br>
        Our drop-down menus give you the option to compare and contrast all four values in whatever pairing as well as filtering out the gender. <br> </p>

      In terms of closing the wage gap, there has been substantial progress. Not only do women earn almost as much as men do, <br>
      but in some sectors, they even earn more. Men make more in five of the ten job titles in the sample on average, while women make more in five. <br>
      As a Marketing associate and a Software Engineer, there is a significant wage disparity between men and women. As a Data Scientist and a <br>
      Warehouse Associate, men earn around $6,000 less than women. <br> </p>

      Through this project, we have learned a more in-depth understanding of the gender pay discrepancy in the United States of America. <br>
      Our three main takeaways are: <br>
    - Men receive more compensation for their work not only based on bonus amount but as well as salary base pay. <br>
    - We found a commonality between the genders, primarily their pay rate increasing through age. <br>
    - And lastly, we found that even with regards to other hiring/promotion factors like seniority, age, and evaluation men <br>
      still receive a higher amount than women even with equal qualifications. <br>
              <br><br>
      Although the existence of the gender pay gap is evidence of gender biases it is promising to see that throughout the years the gap is <br>
      decreasing and can be dismantled. <br></p>
