Aggregate Table Script - Bella 
	Groupby function to answer questions about the dataset
The second file you should save in your project directory should create a table of aggregate information about it. It must perform a groupby operation to show a dimension of the dataset as grouped by a particular feature (column). We expect the included table to:
Have well formatted (i.e., human readable) column names (so you'll probably have to change them)
Only contain relevant information (i.e., only select some columns of interest)
Be intentionally sorted in a meaningful way
Round any quantitative values so they are displayed in a manner that isn't distracting
When you display the table in your index.Rmd file, you must also describe why you included the table, and what information it reveals.
