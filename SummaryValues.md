# Summary of Values:

The five values that are presesnted in this summary are; the minimum base pay for men and women, the maximum base pay for men and women, the minimum bonus 
amount for men and women,the maximum bonus amount for men and women, and lastly the amount of PhD degree holders for men and women. These values were chosen to show the
difference in wages between men and women in the workplace. First the minimum base pay to see how little a woman makes compared to how little a man makes. 
Then the maximum base pay to find how much a woman makes compared to how little a man makes. With the bonus amount the same thinking was given there to see how 
little and how much a man makes compared to women. Now with the degree data makeup I chose the number of PhD degrees to see the standard of education between 
working men and women.
What was found was the minimum base pay for men was 36,642 while the minimum base pay for women was 34,208. The maximum base pay for men was 179,726, while the
maximum base pay for women was 160,614. Clearly it is seen here on just the base pay men make more than women. Next we found how the minimum bonus amount for men was
1,703, while for women it was 1,884. With the maximum bonus amount for men being  11,293, while for women being 10,768. The number of PhD male holders was 132,
while the number of female PhD holders was 106. Lastly we see here that surprisingly women have a greater minimum bonus amount but still recieve less in the maximum bonus amount, as well as holding less PhD's than men.
